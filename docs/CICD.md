# CI/CD

Workflows live in `.github/workflows/`. Every third-party action is pinned to a full commit SHA
(Dependabot keeps the pins current). Each workflow defaults to `permissions: contents: read`;
only the release `publish` job gets `contents: write`.

## ci.yml (every push / pull request)

| Job | Runner | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Rust core | ubuntu, macos, windows | `cargo fmt --check` (Linux), `cargo clippy -D warnings`, `cargo test --locked` |
| Loopback latency benchmark | ubuntu | `annex-bench`, uploads `bench-results/loopback.{json,csv}`; fails if p95 > 25 ms |
| macOS app | macos-latest | `xcodebuild test`, then an unsigned universal `.dmg` artifact |
| Windows app | windows-latest | builds `annex_ffi.dll`, `dotnet test` interop tests against it, builds the WinUI app, packages an unsigned x64 installer artifact |
| Supply chain | ubuntu | `cargo deny check` (advisories, licenses, bans, sources) + `cargo audit` |

`codeql.yml` analyzes Rust, C#, Swift and the workflows themselves (on push to main, PRs, weekly).
`dependabot.yml` covers cargo, NuGet and GitHub Actions (Swift has no packages yet).
Caches: cargo registry + `core/target`, NuGet (via setup-dotnet + lock files), SwiftPM.
Superseded runs are cancelled by a concurrency group.

The Windows virtual display driver job (WDK build) is added with the driver in M4.

## release.yml

Triggers: tag `vX.Y.Z` (or `vX.Y.Z-rc.N`), or **workflow_dispatch** with `dry_run` (default
true), which builds and uploads every artifact as a workflow artifact without creating a release.

1. **version**: version comes from the tag (or the input / `core/Cargo.toml` for dry runs).
2. **macos** (environment `release`): selects the pinned Xcode (`.xcode-version`), stamps the
   version into the Rust core (`scripts/stamp-version.sh`), imports the Developer ID cert into
   a temporary keychain, builds a **universal** app, signs it with hardened runtime, notarizes
   with `notarytool` (App Store Connect API key), staples, and packages a signed `.dmg`.
3. **windows** (environment `release`, x64 + arm64): builds the core and the self-contained
   WinUI app, signs binaries with `signtool` if a certificate is configured, packages
   `Annex-Setup-<version>-<arch>.exe` (Inno Setup, preinstalled on the runners) and signs it.
4. **publish** (`contents: write`): SHA-256 sums (`SHA256SUMS.txt`), SPDX SBOMs (syft),
   and `gh release create --draft --generate-notes`. **You publish the draft manually.**

### Required secrets (environment `release`, with required reviewers)

| Secret | Used for |
|---|---|
| `MACOS_CERT_P12_BASE64` | Developer ID Application certificate + key, base64 of the .p12 |
| `MACOS_CERT_PASSWORD` | Password of that .p12 |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Your 10-character team ID |
| `ASC_API_KEY_ID`, `ASC_API_ISSUER_ID`, `ASC_API_KEY_P8` | App Store Connect API key for notarization (contents of the .p8) |
| `WIN_CERT_PFX_BASE64`, `WIN_CERT_PASSWORD` | Windows code-signing certificate (OV/EV) as base64 .pfx |

All are optional: without them the jobs still succeed and produce ad-hoc signed (macOS) or
unsigned (Windows) builds, and print a warning. Secrets are only written to `$RUNNER_TEMP` and
deleted in `always()` steps. Nothing is echoed; the signing identity is masked.

To set up the environment: Settings → Environments → New environment `release` → add
required reviewers → add the secrets above.

### Cutting a release

1. Bump `version` in `core/Cargo.toml` (workspace) and commit. Optional: the workflow stamps
   the tag version anyway.
2. `git tag v0.2.0 && git push origin v0.2.0`
3. Approve the `release` environment deployment in the Actions run.
4. Review the draft release (artifacts, checksums, SBOMs, notes), then **Publish**.

### Rotating certificates

- **Apple**: create a new Developer ID Application certificate in your developer account,
  export it with its key as .p12, base64 it (`base64 -i cert.p12 | pbcopy`), and replace
  `MACOS_CERT_P12_BASE64` / `MACOS_CERT_PASSWORD`. Rotate the App Store Connect API key under
  Users and Access → Integrations, then replace the three `ASC_*` secrets and revoke the old key.
- **Windows**: replace `WIN_CERT_PFX_BASE64` / `WIN_CERT_PASSWORD`. If you move to Azure
  Trusted Signing, swap the "Prepare code signing" step for the Trusted Signing action with
  OIDC (no long-lived secret).
- Old signatures stay valid because they are timestamped.

## Reproducibility

Pinned: Rust toolchain (`rust-toolchain.toml`), `Cargo.lock` (`--locked` everywhere), Xcode
(`.xcode-version`, release), .NET SDK (`apps/windows/global.json`), NuGet lock files, action
SHAs. Rebuilding a tag reproduces the same inputs. Signed and notarized binaries are not
byte-for-byte identical across builds (signatures and timestamps differ), and we don't claim
they are.

## What hosted runners cannot verify

Hosted runners have no display, GPU encoder or second machine, and can't load drivers.
These stay manual (see `docs/TESTING.md`) or need a self-hosted runner:

- Real screen capture (Screen Recording permission, ScreenCaptureKit / Windows Graphics Capture)
- Hardware encoders (the macOS test falls back to software if no hardware encoder exists)
- The Windows viewer window (D3D11 video processor, Media Foundation decode)
- mDNS discovery between machines, Wi-Fi / wired latency
- Virtual display creation (M4) and driver loading
- Installer UI flows (install to another drive, uninstall cleanup)
